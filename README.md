# Lisp Static Site Generator

This is a Common Lisp System, `lisp-site-gen`, which provides two packages:

* `md-parser` - Markdown Parser
* `site-gen`  - Static Site Generator

The `site-gen` package can be used to generate a static website from markdown and HTML files.

The `md-parser` package is used by `site-gen` to parse markdown, but can also be used separately.
